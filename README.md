Electricity Demand Forecasting: Data Processing & Regression Modeling
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on loading, cleaning, analyzing, and modeling electricity demand data. The dataset includes electricity consumption and weather data in various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.). The primary goal is to build a regression model that predicts electricity demand based on historical trends and external factors.

```

🛠️ Step 1: Data Loading & Integration
Objective: Load and merge multiple data files while ensuring format consistency.

🔹 Tasks:
✅ Scan the data/ folder and load all relevant files (CSV, JSON, etc.)
✅ Validate file formats and handle encoding issues
✅ Merge data into a unified Pandas DataFrame
✅ Log dataset details (record count, missing values, feature types)
📌 Key Libraries Used:
```python
import os, glob
import pandas as pd
```
🧹 Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Objective: Clean and transform the data for analysis and modeling.

🔹 Tasks:
✅ Handle missing values (imputation or deletion based on MCAR/MAR/MNAR)
✅ Convert data types (timestamps → datetime, categorical encoding)
✅ Remove duplicates and ensure consistency
✅ Feature Engineering (extracting hour, day, season, holiday flags)
📌 Example Code Snippet:
```python
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
df['hour'] = df['timestamp'].dt.hour
df['is_weekend'] = df['timestamp'].dt.weekday >= 5
```
📊 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Understand the structure, trends, and patterns in the data.

🔹 Tasks:
✅ Compute statistical summaries (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis)
✅ Visualize trends using line plots, histograms, and boxplots
✅ Compute correlation matrix to detect feature relationships
✅ Perform time series decomposition to separate trend & seasonality
📌 Example Visualizations:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```
⚠️ Step 4: Outlier Detection & Handling
Objective: Identify and manage anomalous data points.

🔹 Methods Used:
✅ Interquartile Range (IQR): Flagging outliers outside 1.5×IQR
✅ Z-score Method: Identifying extreme values with |Z| > 3
📌 Example Code Snippet:
```python
Q1, Q3 = df['electricity_demand'].quantile([0.25, 0.75])
IQR = Q3 - Q1
outliers = df[(df['electricity_demand'] < Q1 - 1

📈 Step 5: Regression Modeling
Objective: Train a predictive model for electricity demand forecasting.

🔹 Steps Taken:
✅ Feature Selection: Used time-based predictors (hour, day, temperature)
✅ Train-Test Split: Divided data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
✅ Model Selection: Implemented Linear Regression as a baseline model
✅ Evaluation Metrics: Used MSE, RMSE, R² score

📌 Example Code Snippet:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error  

model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)  

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)  
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)  
🚀 Next Steps & Enhancements
🔹 Optimize Feature Engineering to improve model performance
🔹 Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM for time series)
🔹 Deploy the model using a web API or dashboard
